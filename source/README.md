# 6CC545 CW1 - Week 01 student wireframe

This is a cumulative scaffold, not a completed solution. Read the supplied weekly TASKS.md and the weekly workbook. Earlier TODOs remain deliberately unimplemented. Merge new files into your own repository; never overwrite completed earlier work.

## Build status

The source compiles, but assessment tests intentionally fail until TODOs are implemented.

```text
go build ./...
go test ./... -run "^TestSmoke_"
go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 20s
go vet ./...
```

Green smoke tests only validate supplied infrastructure. They are not checkpoint completion. Do not skip, delete or weaken acceptance tests. Add your own tests. Use a fresh supported toolchain approved by the module team; the go.mod language compatibility baseline is Go 1.23.

## Safety

Use loopback and synthetic test data. These CW1 services have no TLS or authentication and must not be exposed to other networks.

## Start nodes after completing TODOs

Bash: `sh scripts/run-node-a.sh` and, in another terminal, `sh scripts/run-node-b.sh`.
PowerShell: `./scripts/run-node-a.ps1` and `./scripts/run-node-b.ps1`.
The scripts rebuild the executable and start it in the foreground. Use Ctrl+C to stop it.
HTTP addresses: A `127.0.0.1:8081`, B `127.0.0.1:8082`.
